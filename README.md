# 👋 Hi, I'm Kavin!
Junior at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Looking for oppurtunaties to learn and grow in the field of data science and machine learning.

I love building cool things with code and making life easier (shoutout to **Acehive**!). When I'm not coding, I’m probably debugging something… or pretending to.
